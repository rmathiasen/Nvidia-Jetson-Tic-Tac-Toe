    "Before you run this notebook, go to the \"classification_interactive.ipynb\" to train a model to use for the game. First make TASK = 'tic-tac-toe' and CATEGORIES = ['x', 'y', 'blank']. Then take pictures for each category following the notebook instructions, train the model, and save the model. I did 25 pictures for each category and 25 epochs of training for the demo in my YouTube video. But fell free to experiment to see how you can improve your accuracy."
